# Security Policy

## Supported versions

While Crochet and Kate are in their experimental phase, only the latest `experimental` release is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability from GitHub's Security Advisory tab (the "Report a vulnerability") button, 
or you can [privately email the security group](mailto:security@qteati.me) to discuss it. Either way
you choose, a maintainer will get back to you to discuss the details and work towards a patch and
public announcement for it.

Note that vulnerabilities in dependencies that Crochet and Kate use should rather be reported to the
maintainers of those dependencies.
